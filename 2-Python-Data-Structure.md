# Python TUPLE â€“ Pack, Unpack, Compare, Slicing, Delete, Key

## What is Tuple Matching in Python?

**Tuple Matching in Python** *is a method of grouping the tuples by matching the second element in the tuples. It is achieved by using a dictionary by checking the second element in each tuple in python programming. However, we can make new tuples by taking portions of existing tuples.*

- Tuple Syntax

```py
Tup = ('Jan','feb','march')
```

- To write an empty tuple, you need to write as two parentheses containing nothing-

```
tup1 = ();
```

- For writing tuple for a single value, you need to include a comma, even though there is a single value. Also at the end you need to write semicolon as shown below.

```py
Tup1 = (50,);
```

- Tuple indices begin at 0, and they can be concatenated, sliced and so on.
