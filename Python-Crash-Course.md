## What is Python and why it is used?

*Python is a general-purpose programming language that has wide application in various fields. In this documentation, we look at some areas in which Python is used, for example in web development, desktop app development, data science, building Internet of Things, creating distributed systems, etc.*

*What can you do with Python? There are many, many cool things! We take a look, as well as cover what you will learn in this documentation.*

## How Should I Start Learning Python?

*You might be wondering: How and why should I start learning Python? To help you answer that, we’ll look at various programming languages and compare a few popular ones with Python.*

*You'll find out why Python is a useful tool to have under your belt whether you are learning your first language or looking to learn an additional one. You’ll find out why Python is especially a good language to learn for first-time developers.*

## Python 2 vs Python 3

*We look at the history of Python and explore the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. For the course, we use (and recommend) Python 3.* 

*Python 2 is legacy, Python 3 is the future and so we recommend learning the latter. The two versions share similarities, so if you learn Python 3, you will still be able to read and understand any legacy Python 2 code you might come upon.*
