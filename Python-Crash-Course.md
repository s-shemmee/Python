## What is Python and why it is used?

*Python is a general-purpose programming language that has wide application in various fields. In this documentation, we look at some areas in which Python is used, for example in web development, desktop app development, data science, building Internet of Things, creating distributed systems, etc.*

*What can you do with Python? There are many, many cool things! We take a look, as well as cover what you will learn in this documentation.*

## How Should I Start Learning Python?

*You might be wondering: How and why should I start learning Python? To help you answer that, we’ll look at various programming languages and compare a few popular ones with Python.*

- So I'll give you three examples in PHP, Python, and Ruby.
 > Php

```php
echo "Hello World";
```

> Ruby

```ruby
puts "Hello World"
```

> Python

```python
print ("Hello World")
```

*Now if I run this code and we'll talk more about what running code the end result I get is the text Hello World.*

*So the outcome is exactly the same but the way that it looks is a little different like you might have noticed that the PHP has a semicolon at the end, that Python has that parenthesis around the Hello World, Ruby doesn't have either of those but the end result is exactly the same.*

*You'll find out why Python is a useful tool to have under your belt whether you are learning your first language or looking to learn an additional one. You’ll find out why Python is especially a good language to learn for first-time developers.*

## Python 2 vs Python 3

*We look at the history of Python and explore the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. For the course, we use (and recommend) Python 3.* 

*Python 2 is legacy, Python 3 is the future and so we recommend learning the latter. The two versions share similarities, so if you learn Python 3, you will still be able to read and understand any legacy Python 2 code you might come upon.*


## Setup and Basic Python

### Installing Python and Setting Up Your Development Environment (IDE)

Before you can start coding with Python, you have to ensure that your computer is set up right. I'll take you through the process of installing Python on your MacOS, Windows or Linux OS via the Anaconda distribution. After that, you'll need to install a code editor. I use Sublime Text and would suggest it for this course. But you can use any text editor you prefer.

2. Can We Take A Sanity Check?
"How do I know which version of Python I have?" is one of the most common questions I hear from students. In this lecture, I'll show you how to verify that you set up your development environment right. You'll test your Python installation and ensure that you have the right version of Python installed—version 3.0 or later.
