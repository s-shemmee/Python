# Python math functions

*One thing computers are great at is performing computations. In this lesson, we'll do some Math using Python. You'll learn how to use the common arithmetic operators (e.g. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Modulus) as well as the rules governing the order in which they are executed.*

*Python is famous for it's ability to do amazing things with numbers and math. Check out the operations that you can do in the comments:* 

```py
# + plus
# - minus
# / divide
# * times
# ** exponentiation
# % modulo
# < less then
# > greater then

print("What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?", int((40 + 30 - 7) * 2 / 3))
```

*Remember that modulo basically divides one number by a number.*

## Let's practice some Python math

```py
print("Is it true that 5 * 2 > 3 * 4?")

print(5 * 2 > 3 * 4)

print("What is 5 * 2?", 5 * 2)
print("What is 3 * 4?", 3 * 4)
```

*Which gives this on the command line:*

```bash
$ code python3 mymath.py 
What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything? 42
Is it true that 5 * 2 > 3 * 4?
False
What is 5 * 2? 10
What is 3 * 4? 12
```

*Remember that you can use parentheses in Python math the same way you would do in regular math.*
