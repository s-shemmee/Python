# Python Lists

*A list in Python is a collection of data. Lists can hold numbers, strings, boolean values (1 or 0), and other data structures (for instance, a list of lists!).*

## Python lists 

*Lists are basically that. Lists of things.*

- In `lists.py`:

```
the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
stocks = ["AAPL", "GOOG", "TSLA"]
random_things = ["Puppies", 55, "Anthony Weiner", 1/2, ["Oh no", "A list inside a list"]]
```

*A list can have anything you want inside it: numbers, strings, even lists inside of lists. That last one is an example of nesting structure. And if that makes your head hurt, break it down into smaller pieces.*
