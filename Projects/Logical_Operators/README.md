## Logic Operators

*In this lesson, we look at Python logical operators. The most popular ones you need to know are: `and`, `or` ,` not`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`. You'll also learn how to determine if a value is either True or False.*

*The most popular truth terms in Python are: `and`, `or` , `not`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`.*

*There's also `in`, which is a way of putting strings or variables together. As in:*

```bash
$ python
>>> people = ["Mattan", "Chris", "Sarah"]
>>> "Mattan" in people
True
```

## Boolean Practice Challenge

*Time to put your newfound knowledge of Python logical operators to the test. In this lesson, you will download a .py (Python) file containing a list of conditional tests that evaluate to either True or False.*

## Boolean Practice Solutions

*Did you work through the last challenge? If you didn't, we recommend you go back and work through it before proceeding. Practicing is the best way to learn coding (or anything else). If you worked through the challenge, watch this lesson for the solutions to each of the problems and see how you did!*
